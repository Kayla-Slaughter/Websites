            My name is Kayla Slaughter and I am 30 years old. I am 
            a mother of two and have been married for 10 years. I have 
            a son who is turning two and a daughter who just turned six. My 
            husband is a veteran and served for 8 years. We both work for 
            Amazon. I am currently in school and I am a dog person. I have
            a dog named Jake who gets on my nerves but I love him. I wanted
            more but my husband said no.
