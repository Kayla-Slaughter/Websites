            Better days are just around the corner.....They are called Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. 
            Relationships are like a walk in the park. Jurassic Park. I am on a seafood diet. I see 
            food, and I eat it. People said follow your dreams, so I went back to bed.
            When nothing is going right, go left. People say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing 
            every day. Some people just need a high-five. In the face. With a chair.

            All my life I thought air was free. Then I bought a bag of chips. It takes real skills to 
            choke on air, fall up the stairs and trip over nothing. I have those skills. They say learn
            from your mistakes. That's why I 'm making as many as possible. Soon, I'll be a genius! I 
            am not lazy I am on energy saving mode. Some people just need a high-five. In the face.
            With a chair. People say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing every day.
